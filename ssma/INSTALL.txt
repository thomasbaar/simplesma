The repository ssma contains the following files and folders:

LICENSE  - license 
README.md - Github's readme file

Eclipse projects:
-----------------
de.htwberlin.selab.princessintegration (+ .test)  - wrapper Java project for prover PRINCESS + unit tests
ssma.fml (+ .sdk, .tests, .ui, .examples) - Xtext-projects for a simple expression language needed to express guards, updates, and invariants in simple state machines
ssma.sminv (+ .sdk, .tests, .ui, .examples) - Xtext-projects for simple state machines; note that some of these projects depend on corresponding project from ssma.fml.*


Installation steps:
-------------------
- It is assumed you have installed Eclipse with the Xtext-plugin 
(can be downloaded alltogether from https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/download.html )
of the supported version (see README.md)

- Clone the repository ssma on your local machine

- Import all Eclipse projects from Git into your workspace

- Copy .classpath.example to .classpath for all Eclipse projects where possible --
  Note that .classpath  often contains settings, which are valid only on the local machine.
  Thus, the file .classpath was not checked-in. Please, copy in each project where you 
  find .classpath.example this file to .classpath. Since, .classpath.example contains
  only a proposal for a meaningful .classpath, you should check whether after copying
  your .classpath has valid entries wrt. your machine.
  
- Generate the language infrastructure for project ssma.fml and ssma.sminv --  
  This is done (as usual in Xtext) by right-click on the project's grammar file
  (file extension .xtext) and choosing 'Run As > Generate Xtext Artifacts'. Since 
  the project ssma.sminv depends on ssma.fml, you should start with generating
  the language infrastructure for ssma.fml.
  
- Now, all errors in the pane 'Problems' should have disappeared :-) 

- Start the runtime Eclipse by a right-click on a project 'Run As > Eclipse Application'
  to see the editors for ssma.fml and ssma.sminv in action. Example input files can be
  found in ssma.fml.examples and ssma.sminv.examples.
